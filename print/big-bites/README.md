# Big Bites — A3 trifold menu (print)

    node print/big-bites/build-menu.mjs   # data -> menu.html
    node print/big-bites/render.mjs       # menu.html -> PDF + preview.png

Prices come from `data/shops/food-station/menu-visual.json` and the phone,
address, hours and delivery terms from `config.json` — the same files the
website and the till use. **Change a price there, re-run these two commands,
reprint.** The printed menu cannot drift from what you actually charge.

## Spec

- **426 × 303 mm** = A3 landscape (420 × 297) + **3 mm bleed** all round
- Three **140 mm** panels per side, double-sided (2 pages)
- Fold guides are the dashed lines between panels — they do not print as marks,
  so tell the printer it is a trifold and which way
- Equal thirds suit a **Z / concertina fold**. For a **roll fold** the tucked
  panel wants ~2 mm shaving; the printer will advise
- QR is **vector** (segno, error correction H) pointing at
  https://bigbiteseasingwold.co.uk

## Before sending to print

`render.mjs` reports `panels fit` or lists any panel whose content overruns its
box. Never send a PDF that reported an overflow — content will be cut at the
fold.

The PDF is **RGB**. Most printers convert, but ask: if they want CMYK supplied,
convert with Ghostscript or ask them to do it.

## Errors this replaced

The ChatGPT-generated artwork had, checked against live data:

- phone **824522** — the real number is **820820**
- Burger Sauce and Chilli Mayo priced at **£1.90**; they are £1. The £1.90 pots
  are **Pot Curry** and **Pot Gravy**
- "COLDER" instead of Mango Cooler / Strawberry Cooler
- "Can of Coke£12" — price collided with the item
- "FRESH & LOADDED" in the footer ticker
- "WEBSITE.WEBSITE" placeholder and a QR pointing nowhere
