## Payments — split / part payment
- [x] **Refund an in-person counter-card sale.** `refund.js` + `status.js` now
      accept `paymentMethod === 'counter_card'` (single PI), so a Terminal sale is
      refundable in-app and auto-refunded on cancel. (2026-07 review.)
- [ ] **Refund a split payment.** A split order (`paymentMethod: 'split'`, with
      `payment.parts[]`) still can't be refunded from the till — it carries
      multiple card PIs (one per part). Needs: refund the card part(s) via their
      stored `intentId`, return/adjust the cash part as a manual note, and cap the
      refundable to what was actually taken. Also handle cancelling a split paid
      order (currently it voids without refunding the card part).
- [ ] Split when settling an **existing** unpaid order (currently new sales only).
- [ ] **Per-unit** item splitting (today a multi-qty line is assigned whole).
- [ ] Item split across **more than 2 people**.

## Notes
- Split foundation already shipped: `payment.parts[]` (cumulative), partial card
  charges (`terminal/charge` / `pay.js` `amountP`), Z-report attribution by part.
